As a global community, we are experiencing unprecedented change on what seems like a daily basis. Here in the College of Engineering, we are committed to our educational and research mission. At the same time, many of us also have, as they say, dropped everything and devoted our expertise to help our state, country and world combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Here are some examples of this work.

At UW-Madison, contactless thermometer helps monitor student health
Lennon Rodgers, director of the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s Grainger Engineering Design Innovation Laboratory, created a prototype “contactless” thermometer by borrowing the sensor from a commercially available thermometer and adding a microcontroller and distance sensor controlled by open-source code.

Now, devices based on that initial design are helping UW–Madison students monitor their COVID-19 symptoms. They’ve been deployed in residence halls on campus set aside for students isolating for at least 10 days after a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. Rodgers passed his initial idea to Nathan Strachen, a UW–Madison electrical and computer engineering graduate student and a Fab Fellow at the innovation lab. Strachen has made his own set of tweaks.

Regaining balance: How women faculty can navigate expectations in a pandemic world
While the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted academia as a whole, the crunch of balancing research, teaching and family responsibilities has fallen particularly hard on women faculty members. With that in mind, Biomedical Engineering Associate Professor Pamela Kreeger and frequent collaborator Kristyn Masters, a Vilas Distinguished Professor of biomedical engineering and H.I. Romnes Faculty Fellow at UW-Madison, have put together a list of 10 suggestions for women principal investigators to better navigate the juggling act of research, teaching, mentorship, service and at-home commitments during the pandemic. Their article, published in the journal PLOS Computational Biology and coauthored with seven other women faculty members from across the country, drew more than 5,000 views within 24 hours of publishing online, along with a steady stream of tweets.

COVID-19 data model quantifies region-specific impact of social distancing orders
As the COVID-19 pandemic first took hold in regions across the United States in spring 2020, governors, mayors and local leaders hoping to quell the spread of the virus turned to the only actionable defenses available at the time: They closed schools and businesses, banned mass gatherings, issued stay-at-home orders and enforced other social distancing measures. Now, a study published Oct. 27, 2020, in the Annals of Internal Medicine by University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers quantifies the region-specific impact of social distancing measures on the COVID-19 caseload in three distinct areas: New York City, the Milwaukee metropolitan area and Dane County in Wisconsin.

Oguzhan Alagoz, Proctor and Gamble-Bascom Professor of industrial and systems engineering in the College of Engineering, and Nasia Safdar, professor of medicine in the School of Medicine and Public Health and UW Health medical director of infection control, led the research team. The group also included School of Medicine and Public Health researchers Ajay Sethi, professor of population health sciences; Brian Patterson, assistant professor of emergency medicine; and Matthew Churpek, associate professor of medicine.

More poll workers and no arenas: Operations researchers offer guidelines for resilient voting systems
As cities and other municipalities prepare for a 2020 presidential election that will be unlike any before it, set against the backdrop of a pandemic, they face dilemmas in how to structure and staff their in-person polling places: How can they best protect voters and poll workers from COVID-19? How do they minimize wait times? What if there are shortages of poll workers? Should they consolidate polling locations or turn to sports arenas as voting sites? Laura Albert, a professor of industrial and systems engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and PhD student Adam Schmidt have analyzed some of the options in a report they’ve shared with the Wisconsin Elections Commission ahead of the Nov. 3 election.

Fitter increases the benefits of wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic
Whether homemade or commercially manufactured, breathable cloth and disposable face masks fit everybody differently, leaving gaps at the top, sides, bottom—or any combination thereof—that could allow virus particles to escape. Now, a team of University of Wisconsin–Madison engineers has developed a simple and inexpensive do-it-yourself fitter that ensures a tighter mask seal around the wearer’s nose, mouth and face.

Known as the Badger Seal, the mask fitter is a soft, adjustable “frame” with elastic worn either as ear loops or behind the head. With readily available materials, such as elastic cord, foam wire or pipe cleaners, the fitter is easy to make at home in minutes. When worn over non-medical-grade disposable masks, the Badger Seal significantly improves the masks’ filtration performance, according to research conducted by Scott Sanders and David Rothamer, UW–Madison professors of mechanical engineering and experts in measuring gases and particles in internal combustion engine processes.

Everybody poops, some shed the virus that causes COVID-19. Wisconsin’s wastewater surveillance is looking for it.
It’s like searching for a needle in a haystack. Except the haystack is human excrement. The needle, a tiny fragment of the tiny genetic material of a tiny virus that has, since December 2019, had a massive impact on the world. Scientists at the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, with collaborators at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Freshwater Sciences, are sifting through raw sewage collected once or twice per week from nearly 100 wastewater treatment facilities statewide, and at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, in search of the genetic fingerprint of the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. Detecting and measuring how much virus there is may provide an early warning signal that cases of COVID-19 may soon rise and provide a readout of how levels of virus change in a population over time. It could give hospitals time to prepare for an increase in patients.

At UW–Madison, wastewater surveillance also provides an opportunity to target campus testing (UW–Madison is offering no-cost testing for all students and employees), isolation and quarantine, and limit disease spread. This is especially important since the virus can transmit from person-to-person before symptoms begin, and some people with the virus never develop symptoms at all. “We picked this up in late March and said this is really something we should be doing,” says Martin Shafer, a scientist at the WSLH and the UW–Madison College of Engineering. “We put a proposal into the (Wisconsin) Department of Health Services, and it was funded … It’s the largest in terms of the number of wastewater facilities in the country.”

A research-based guide to choosing the right mask for you
For many Americans, face coverings have become a way of life amid the COVID-19 pandemic. And whether citizens are wearing a mask to comply with an order, trying to stay healthy, working to keep the community healthy—or all of the above—there’s a mask option that works with people’s preferences, lifestyle and goals, says Scott Sanders, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

A researcher who uses optical techniques to study and measure particulates in internal-combustion engine processes, Sanders more recently has applied his expertise to studying the efficacy of non-medical-grade mask alternatives. In his latest tests, Sanders used a mannequin not wearing a mask to show how particles from a human breath and droplets from a sneeze spray forward. Then, he studied how adding various face coverings—including a face shield, a homemade four-layer tightly knit mask, and a disposable non-medical-grade filtering mask—to the mannequin trapped or released those particles and droplets.
